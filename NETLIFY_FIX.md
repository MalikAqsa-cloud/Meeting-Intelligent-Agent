# ðŸ”§ Fix Netlify 404 Error

## ðŸš¨ Problem: Site not found (404)
This happens when Netlify can't find the correct build output.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Manual Netlify Deployment

### Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. On the dashboard, look for "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"
4. Drag and drop the `frontend/dist` folder directly
5. You'll get an instant URL!

### Method 2: Git Deployment (Proper)
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Choose GitHub and select your repository
4. Configure:
   - **Base directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend/dist`
5. Deploy!

### Method 3: Netlify CLI (Advanced)
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=frontend/dist
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your URL will be:
`https://random-name-123.netlify.app`

## ï¿½ï¿½ Connect to Backend:
Once you have your Netlify URL, you can:
1. Go to Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app`
3. Redeploy

## âœ… This will definitely work!
